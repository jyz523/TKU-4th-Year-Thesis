                    <h3>Q1: What is National Health Insurance (NHI)?</h3>
                    <p>The National Health Insurance is a compulsory medical insurance program run by the Taiwan government which ensures that every resident has access to quality and affordable medical care. NHI enrolment is mandatory for all citizens and foreign residents, including foreign students who are enrolled in a full-time program at a Taiwan university (after a waiting period of 6 months). With over 92 percent of clinics and hospitals contracted to NHI, patients have a wide choice of doctors or hospitals to choose from. Exchange students who are not covered by the NHI, still have access to all NHI health care facilities, but have to check with their insurance companies which expenses will be covered.</p>
                    <h3>Q2: Who can apply?</h3>
                    <p>International Students staying in Taiwan for at least 6 months and holding a valid Alien Residence Certificate (ARC) are eligible to apply for the NHI and receive benefits (cf. National Health Law Article 9 Item 1)</p>
                    <h3>Q3: How much is the NHI fee?</h3>
                    <p>The NHI fee for students is currently set at NTD 826 per month and will be collected every six months (NTD 4,956). It is included in the tuition fee payments at the beginning of each semester. Students are insured for the whole academic year, including summer and winter vacations. You have to continue paying insurance fees during the spring and summer vacation, even if you are not staying in Taiwan during that time. Emergency medical bills paid outside of Taiwan are reimbursed during these periods as long as proper medical certificates and receipts are presented (reimbursement is capped, based on standards in Taiwan). Students who refuse to join the program will be fined between NT3,000 to NT15,000. As long as the fine has been not paid, NHI will not cover any medical expenses even applicants have resumed paying their NHI fees in the meantime (cf. National Health Law, Article 88).</p>
                    <h3>Q4: How to pay the NHI fee?</h3>
                    <p>You will be eligible to join the NHI program after a waiting period of six months. With the beginning of the 2nd semester, the NHI fees will be included in the tuition fee which can be paid online, at the post office, or at convenient stores. When your status changes, e.g. if you graduate, drop out, or take Leave of Absence from Taiwan Tech, or if you have a part-time job outside the campus, please don't forget to notify us by email <a href="mailto:oia@mail.ntust.edu.tw">oia@mail.ntust.edu.tw</a> under the subject line "Change of status: NHI insurance" to avoid unnecessary payments.</p>
                    <h3>Q5: What is covered under NHI program?</h3>
                    <p>The coverage includes both inpatient and outpatient care, prescription drugs, traditional Chinese medicine, dental services and home nursing care. Please check the <a href="https://www.nhi.gov.tw/english/">NHI Website</a> for details. Patients have free choice of doctors and access to specialist treatment. The insured person needs to pay a share of the fees for each medical visit, i.e. a registration fee and other fees as required by the clinic or hospitals. The costs for the treatment and medication is largely covered by the NHI, i.e. subsidized by the Taiwan Government. If you receive medical treatment abroad, you may apply for reimbursement of such medical expenses with proper receipts & medical certificates. Reimbursements are made in accordance with the <a href="http://www.nhi.gov.tw/english/Content_List.aspx?n=EB055A67C769EB25&topn=F291245F2CAF56AF">fee schedules published by the NHI</a>.</p>
